Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With any number of simulations 2019w.csv proved incorrect.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Almost at 100 for 2019w.csv,
